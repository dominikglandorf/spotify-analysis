\title{Clustering Spotify: How diverse is popular music?}

%\bibliography{library}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
{Utilizing the Spotify API, we collect the metadata of a large set of tracks, notably the audio features (e.g. danceability), to assess the cliché of contemporary pop music being all the same.  
  We are aiming to utilize clustering methods (e.g. t-SNE) and create corresponding visualizations. Maybe we also apply data reduction techniques, if they provide further explanatory value. If this not quenches our curiosity, we will predict the popularity of an artist with the metadata of his œuvre.}

\section{Introduction}

Music is one of the oldest and most valued forms of communication and is therefore of particular interest. Yet, its underlying structure has been eluded systematic analysis until recently. The sheer amount of data one gets when comparing numerous features across thousands of songs was to much data to handle with traditional methods of analysis. Accelerated computing and new mathematical methods allow now for systematic inquiry of music.\newline Since it is commonly believed, that pop music does not differ in its content and is all the same [see srep00521], we want  to test, how diverse popular music really is. 

\section{Method}

\subsection{Data}
Since Spotify is the worlds most used music streaming platform and has 70 million tracks available, the data was sampled from there, using the Spotify Web API without authentication as a specific user. The API does not offer a track index endpoint which complicated unbiased sampling. We decided to query the search function for tracks using all letters of the alphabet as a search string. Since the search function will be optimized to give "relevant" results we expect a bias towards popular songs but since we need a crucial number of them for our analysis, we appreciate this bias. That is artists, their popularity, and the numerable audio features from their songs. 
[Elaborate further one used features.]

\subsection{Analysis}
Using the song's features as dimensions, all observed songs where then clustered.
